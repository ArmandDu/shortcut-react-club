# Session Report 03/08/18

This is the first report of the first meeting session held on the 03/08/18.

In the first meeting we decided to have a code along session to implement a [color game](https://shortcut-peer-learning-react.herokuapp.com/color-game/build/).

#### Assignment 0 - [color-game/starter-code](https://github.com/ArmandDu/shortcut-react-club/tree/color-game/starter-code)

We started from scratch for this session. 
We used [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.


We defined the specifications and scope of the project and started to write a static markup of the application.

We wrote our markup to match the [final version](https://shortcut-peer-learning-react.herokuapp.com/color-game/build/) of the app.

The static markup can be found at the [color-game/starter-code](https://github.com/ArmandDu/shortcut-react-club/tree/color-game/starter-code) branch.


#### Assignment 1 - [color-game/assignment-1](https://github.com/ArmandDu/shortcut-react-club/tree/color-game/assignment-1)
The next assignment was to split the static markup into reusable components.

We decided to have 3 components (excluding the App):
- **Header**: in charge of displaying the title and the guess color
- **Controls**: in charge of displaying and handling the game options
- **Squares**: in charge of displaying the squares and handling the interactions 

#### Assignment 2 - [color-game/assignment-2](https://github.com/ArmandDu/shortcut-react-club/tree/color-game/assignment-2)

The next assignment was to start to create some dynamic parts for the application. 

We defined a *state* object in our App component.
The game needs to render 3 or 6 squares. A square has a unique background color and can be visible or hidden.

We decided to create a "squares" attribute in our state which is an array containing objects with keys 'color' and 'hidden'.

```
state = {
	squares: [
		{
			color: 'rgb(rrr, ggg, bbb)',
			hidden: false
		},
		...
	]
}
```

#### Assignment 3 - [color-game/assignment-3](https://github.com/ArmandDu/shortcut-react-club/tree/color-game/assignment-3)

We decided to work on the components.

We first passed the state attribue "squares" as a prop to the Game component
`<Squares squares={this.state.squares}>` and made the modifications to our Game component.

The goal was to render the squares array and set the style property of each square to match the right color and display.

#### Assignment 4 - [color-game/assignment-4](https://github.com/ArmandDu/shortcut-react-club/tree/color-game/assignment-4)

This is where the session ended.

We decided as "homework" to do the next changes:

1. When the page loads, generate 6 random colors
2. Pass a prop 'color' to the Header component that is the color of the first square in the squares array
3. Make the prop 'color' of the Header component be a random color from one of the squares.


Other assignments are to be defined.
