## How to use this repository

This repo contains the react projects and assignments that we will create and work on during the live meeting sessions.
We will compose the repository in multiple branches.

The format is:

**master branch**

This branch hosts the documentation and reports that we will write during the live sessions.

- The documentation includes how to use the repository and the explainations/ressources about different functionalities we learned during the meetings.
- The reports should contain feedback, resources and sumaries of the meetings.

**[project-name]/starter-code**

These branches will host the starter code for the react projects we will build/implement.
Starter code can contain base code source and/or specifications about the project.

Starter branches will be used as the root of the other project branches.

**[project-name]/[assignment-name]**

An assignment is an objective or objectives that we want to achieve either during the live sessions or individually at home.

These branches will follow one another.
After completion of an assignment, a new branch will be created and the next assignments will be described there.
This way learners can start from the "starter code" branch, do the assignments and compare the result with the corresponding branch and get the next assignment.

**[project-name]/complete**

These branches will host the final version of the project (no more assignments).
