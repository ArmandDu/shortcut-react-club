3. Make the Squares component dynamic
 
   - Pass the state attribute 'squares' as a prop to the Squares component
   - Replace the static markup with the dynamic content (using this.props.squares.map)
   - Don't forget to give a key to the square in order to suppress the react warnning
   - Give your square the right 'style' prop to display the right background-color
   - At the end you should see 6 boxes with the color you defined in the App component
